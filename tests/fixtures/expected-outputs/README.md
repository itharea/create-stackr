# Expected Outputs

This directory contains sample expected file structures and outputs for different project configurations.

## Purpose

These fixtures help test that the generator creates the correct directory structure and files for each configuration preset.

## Structure

Each subdirectory represents a different preset configuration:
- `minimal/` - Expected output for minimal preset
- `full-featured/` - Expected output for full-featured preset
- `analytics-focused/` - Expected output for analytics-focused preset

These can be expanded as needed for integration and E2E tests.
