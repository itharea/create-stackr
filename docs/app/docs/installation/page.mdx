# Installation

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and create your first project.

## System Requirements

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm, yarn, or bun
- Git
- Watchman (for macOS users)

## Creating a New Project

Run the initialization command in your terminal:

<CodeBlock code="npx create-stackr@latest my-app" language="bash" />

This will start the interactive setup wizard. You will be asked to choose:

- Project name
- Preset (Minimal, Full-Featured, Analytics-Focused) or Custom
- Features (Authentication, Onboarding, Paywall)
- Integrations (RevenueCat, Adjust, Scate, ATT)
- Package manager (npm, yarn, or bun)

<Callout type="info" title="Package Manager">
    The CLI supports npm, yarn, and bun. Your chosen package manager will be used to install
    dependencies after project generation. See the [CLI Reference](/docs/cli-reference#package-managers) for more details.
</Callout>

## Running the Project

Navigate to your project directory and start the development server:

<CodeBlock
    code={`cd my-app
npm run dev`}
    language="bash"
/>

<Callout type="success" title="Success">
    Your app should now be running! Open the Expo Go app on your phone and scan the QR code to view it.
</Callout>
