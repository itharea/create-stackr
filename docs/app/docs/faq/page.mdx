# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is it free?

Yes, `create-stackr` is open source and free to use.

## Can I use it for commercial projects?

Absolutely! It is licensed under the MIT license.

## Do you support Web?

Yes! We support both Expo for mobile (iOS & Android) and Next.js for web. Both share the same
backend and authentication. See the [Web Platform](/docs/features/web-platform) documentation
for details.

## Can I use the web app without mobile?

Yes! During CLI setup, select "web" as your only platform. This generates just the web app
and backend, without any mobile code.

## Why does web use cookies instead of tokens?

Cookie-based sessions are more secure for web applications - they're HTTP-only (no JavaScript
access), automatically included in requests, and protected against XSS attacks. Mobile apps
use secure token storage because they don't have cookie support.

## Can I share authentication between web and mobile?

Yes, both platforms authenticate against the same backend and share the same user database.
However, sessions are separate - logging in on web doesn't log you in on mobile and vice versa.

## Why doesn't Apple Sign In work on localhost?

Apple requires HTTPS for OAuth redirect URIs. Use ngrok or a similar tunneling service for
local development, or test Apple Sign In in a staging environment with a valid SSL certificate.

## How do I add more pages to the web app?

Create new files in `web/src/app/`. For protected pages, put them in `(app)/`. For public
pages, put them directly in `app/`. See the
[Next.js App Router docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).

## How do I customize the web design?

The web app uses Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components. Edit `globals.css` for color scheme
changes, or modify individual components in `src/components/ui/`.

## Does the web app support SSR?

Yes, Next.js App Router uses React Server Components by default. Client components (marked
with `"use client"`) handle interactive features like forms and auth state.
