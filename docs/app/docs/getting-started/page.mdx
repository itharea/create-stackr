# Getting Started

Welcome to `create-stackr`, the CLI for scaffolding production-ready
full-stack applications with Expo (mobile), Next.js (web), and Fastify (backend).

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
    Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js 18+ and Docker installed on your machine.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is by using our CLI tool. It will guide you through
the setup process and generate a new project with your preferred configuration.

<CodeBlock code="npx create-stackr@latest" language="bash" />
